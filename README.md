# json-parser

## Introduction

Hello, so this will be a brief introduction to a project of mine. This is a json parser written completely in Clojure. 

### So what do I mean when i say JSON parser?
JSON parser, essentialy, takes a string,a text as an input and provides output, which are parsed JSON objects. 
This may seem confusing at first, so I will explain to you what is a parser, what is JSON, and then, I will explain the jist of this project, how the functions work together in unity, and come around to make a JSON parser.
#### Parser
A parser is an algorithm designed in order to take a sequence of tokens and decide whether that sequence is valid in the considered grammar. 
It's the process of breaking apart of data in one well-known consistent format into a format that the program can use for its purpose.
#### JSON
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).

JSON Syntax Rules
Data is in name/value pairs
Data is separated by commas
Curly braces hold objects
Square brackets hold arrays

The example shown below defines an employees object, an array of 3 employee objects:
{
"employees":[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]
}

We will now move to the JSON parser and its' functions.

## JSON Parser

Maybe the best explanation is to go from top to bottom, but first, pay a close attention to a picture shown below.

![json parser drawio](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2565928-2059-4cdc-8f13-f184710dacca)

As you can see from the picture, the main parser consists of multiple smaller parsers, which parse some JSON object.
When input is sent to the main parser, the parser pushes the whole input string to smaller parsers, to check if there is some JSON object to be parsed from the stringv (1.). If there is, the smaller parser sends that value to the main parser (json-value), and the main parser stores that value (3.). If there is no JSON object to be parsed, the main parser tries the remove the separator, which separates JSON objects (,). If the separator can be removed, main parser sends back string to be further parsed (3.). If, albeit, the remove-separator function returns nil, and the main function already received nil from all the smaller parsers, that means that there is no more string to be parsed, and returns the stored output value (4.).

This is the heart of the project, the main part of it.

In this example, you can see how it works:

Input:
{"ab" : 34.4, "cd": "this is a string", "ef": true, "gh"  : false,
"ij": null, "kl": [1,5,2,4,6,[true,false,false]],
"mn": {"op": 63.4, "qr": "string once again", "st" :
{"uv" : false, "wx" : true}}, "yz": 0.003}
Output:
[JsonObject: ["ab" JsonNumber: 34.4], ["cd" JsonString: "this is a string"], ["ef" JsonBool: true], ["gh" JsonBool: false], ["ij" JsonNull: nil], ["kl" JsonArray: [JsonNumber: 1 JsonNumber: 5 JsonNumber: 2 JsonNumber: 4 JsonNumber: 6 JsonArray: [JsonBool: true JsonBool: false JsonBool: false]]], ["mn" JsonObject: ["op" JsonNumber: 63.4], ["qr" JsonString: "string once again"], ["st" JsonObject: ["uv" JsonBool: false], ["wx" JsonBool: true]]], ["yz" JsonNumber: 0.003]]
